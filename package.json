  "changeLog": "**New Features:**\n> - Added Recently Added Notifications. Use command `!bot recentlyadded off` to disable it\n> - Added tvdb link to notifications show react role pages\n> - The `!notifications preview` list now expires after 5 minutes to make it more clear that it is a temporary command\n> - Bot now deletes old `!notifications list` messages on new call\n> - The `!notifications list` command now preserves people's settings from the old list until they become active on the new list\n> - The `!users` command now states the number of users in the embed message\n> - Created a version changelog notifier\n> - Database is backed up on shutdown and startup to allow for version saving between bot upgrades\n> - Database is automatically backed up every 8 hours and kept for up to 7 days\n> - Custom React Role Page can now be edited without recalling `!notifications list`\n\n**Changes:**\n> - Discord.js v12 refactor\n> - Reworked react role events to work better with Discord.js v12 (Because of occasional emoji error)\n> - Split up notifications command, index.js, and database setup into multiple files for easier editing later\n> - Changed setActivity to toggle between help command, number of people watching plex, and the bot version. Changes every 10 seconds\n> - Improved Tautulli error handling\n> - Notifier re-work. All channel related settings were moved to the `!notifiy` command\n\n**Fixes:**\n> - Fixed double watching log notifications (Update - Might Not Be Completely Fixed)\n> - Fixed show notifications resulting in null role if networks not enabled\n> - Fixed alphabetical order being inaccurate with grouped shows\n> - (Untested) Implemented a theoretical fix for discord outages crashing the bot\n> - Fixed unintended bug causing errors during unenroll from react list\n> - Fixed a role react bug where an emoji click during list creation would break the new list from generating"
